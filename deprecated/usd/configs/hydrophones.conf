; SHARC Register Map. Format: index, type, variable name, is pointer?, read only?, description (not included in source)
; ; denotes a comment, # denotes a section header, $ is the number of total registers (un-listed
; registers are filled in with SREG_#, IREG_#, and FREG_# for index variables and sreg#, ireg#, and
; freg$ for the actual macros.), and @ specifies device information
; Indices are for shorts. They can be 2-3, for human reference, but only the two will be read. The size
; will be correctly inferred from the field type. Indices can also be specified as offsets, which makes
; map blocks relocatable

; Number of registers on device
$256

; Device information: name, id, path to device, baud rate
