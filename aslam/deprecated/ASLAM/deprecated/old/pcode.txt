Update:::

Take current state.
Each observation used as Bayesian input to relevant objects, Their position updated prop. obsuncertainty / objuncertainty. Other objects updated AS IF AN OBSERVATION WAS MADE of where it would be observed with new position with uncertainty prop. object covariance.

Heading: Decaying functional probability map: infinite cone.
Distance: Decaying functional probability map: 360d ring.

ProbabilityMap multiplied and renormalized.

Everything as heading/distance?!

Constants:
OBS_IMPACT -- how much a given observation can decrease probabilities by. Lower - faster convergenece, more bad-data risk.
