Bollard pull test on 04/24/14 - 04/25/14

Test explanation:
    set value in set {20, 30, ..., 250, 255} (or negative for reverse)
    wait 10 seconds to achieve steady state
    take 5 samples over 2.5 seconds and average results
    set motor to 0
    wait 5 seconds
    repeat

Batteries were changed after every 2 runs (i.e. forward trial, reverse trial) to minimize the effects of drained batteries on results.

Some thrusters encounted "dead regions". For these thrusters, we consducted a re-test. If the re-test failed, we moved on to the next thruster. These thrusters are suspected to be "bad".

2 Videorays and 1 small videoray were not tested due to lack of an adapter mount. They will be tested at a later date.

reversed thrusters:
    45deg
    fore-port

    (These are thrusters that had to have set values flipped
    because they are hard-wired differently than the others)
