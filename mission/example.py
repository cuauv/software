Hello, and welcome to the new, new & improved mission system and framework example file!
It behoves you to read the whole thing - it's really not that long.

The first thing to note about this file is that IT IS NOT A VALID MISSION - THIS WON'T RUN. This file shows what
could be inside a overridden .on_run method. You shouldn't run tasks from the top level as is done below.
