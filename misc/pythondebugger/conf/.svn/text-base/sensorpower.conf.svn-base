; AVR Register Map. Format: 
; ; denotes a comment, # denotes a section header, $ is the number of total registers, @ is the Device information
; Types are: bool==uint8 (one reg),  uint16 (one reg), uint32 (two regs), int8 (one reg),  int16 (one reg), int32 (two regs), float (two regs)
; arrays of 2 reg values must be an even length

; Required/Reserved stuff
# 0,0,default registers
1, uint16, deviceId, N, Y, Contains the device ID
1, uint16, protocolRev, N, Y, Contains the supported protocol revision number, 0xMMmm, for Major/minor numbers
2, uint32, buildDate, N, Y, 32-bit build date: 0xYYYYMMDD.
1, uint16, hb0, N, N, Write to trigger a HB action
1, uint16, hb1, N, Y, Read to verify HB action (hb0 is copied here on write).
1, uint16, restartState, N, N, Restart status: 0 = fresh, -1 = watchdog. Will be set to -1 when a reset chip command is received
